<H2> Project Purpose </H2>

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in using Python to retrieve restaurant inspection scores from an API, perform data cleaning and manipulation, and showcase the results on a webpage. The main objectives are as follows:

* Data Retrieval: Utilize an API (Application Programming Interface) to retrieve restaurant inspection scores. This API will provide access to a database containing information about various restaurants, including their inspection scores.

* Data Processing: Clean and process the retrieved data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and organizing the data in a structured format suitable for analysis.

* Analysis and Ranking: Analyze the restaurant inspection scores and calculate a ranking based on the scores. Determine the top 10 best and worst restaurants based on these scores. The ranking will serve as the primary basis for evaluating the restaurants.

* Web Development: Create a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implement a search functionality where users can search for specific restaurants and view their inspection scores. The website will showcase the top 10 best and worst restaurants, along with relevant details such as location, and inspection dates.

Overall, this project aims to demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, including working with APIs and manipulating data. Additionally, it showcases web development skills by creating an interactive and visually appealing website for users to access and search restaurant inspection scores.
